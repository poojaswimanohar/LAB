# Prompts for Online Quiz Maker AI Agent

This directory contains prompt examples for the **Online Quiz Maker** AI agent developed for the thesis project:

**Project:** Online Quiz Maker using Google Colab  
**Author:** Mohini Naga Venkata Poojaswi Kankipati  
**Lab:** 1.4 – End-to-End AI Agent Prompts  

## Purpose

The AI agent in this project acts as an **end-to-end solution**:
1. Receives **input X** (e.g., a topic or a student answer)
2. Processes it through multiple stages:
   - Data understanding
   - Quiz creation (question generation)
   - Answer evaluation (grading)
   - Feedback generation
3. Returns **predicted output y** (e.g., a new quiz or graded answer with feedback)

This folder contains two types of prompts:

1. **Zero-shot prompt** – Single new input, without prior examples. Demonstrates generating a quiz or grading a single student answer.  
2. **Few-shot prompt** – Includes several known (X, y) pairs to demonstrate few-shot learning for quiz creation and grading.
