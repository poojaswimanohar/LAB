# Prompts for AI Quiz Agent

This folder contains prompt examples and documentation for the AI agent implemented in the thesis "Online Quiz Maker using Google Colab".

## Prompt Files

1. `prompt_zero_shot.txt`  
   - Demonstrates a **zero-shot** example where the agent receives a new study material and generates a quiz question and answer without prior examples.

2. `prompt_few_shot.txt`  
   - Demonstrates a **few-shot** example where the agent receives a few known (X, y) pairs to guide the quiz generation and grading for a new study material.

## Usage
The AI agent receives input X (study material), processes it through data understanding, inference, reasoning, and output generation, and returns output y (quiz question with options and answer).  

## Notes
- Zero-shot: Agent generates output from a single input, without examples.  
- Few-shot: Agent generates output using examples as guidance for better accuracy and format consistency.
